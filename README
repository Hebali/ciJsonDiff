ciJsonDiff is a set of tools for DIFFing and PATCHing JSON-formatted data.
It is built on top of JsonCpp.

It was devised for use with Cinder applications,
but (in it's present state), there are no Cinder-specific requirements and
should therefore be usable with any application that integrates JsonCpp.

JsonCpp: http://sourceforge.net/projects/jsoncpp
Cinder:  http://libcinder.org

Example usage:
string tDiff = Json::Diff::diff( fs::path( getResourcePath() / "testA.json" ), fs::path( fs::path( getResourcePath() / "testB.json" ) ) );
